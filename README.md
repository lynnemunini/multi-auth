# Multi-Factor Authentication for Spring Boot

This repository contains a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates multi-factor authentication techniques for
securing API endpoints. The project showcases the use of two authentication methods:

- **API Key Authentication:** Validates the identity of servers interacting with the API using custom filters and
  authentication mechanisms.
- **Basic Authentication with Centralized Identity Management:** This is the traditional username and password
  authentication for users, handled through a centralized identity provider.
